Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what your documenting.

### Charting Patterns
This section will list some common patterns that adheres to the basic principles of charting. These patterns may be commonly used but it is important
to remember that charting is far more than stringing common patterns together and this section will only provide some examples on some ways you could
arrange your notes that allows for fluid gameplay that is (mostly) friendly to all playstyles.

Also note that this section will cover mostly tap, match, beat and spin patterns. Slider shapes will be covered in a later chapter.

All the basics, best practices and general advice, all in one place. If you're a beginner charter, this page will help you with putting together a great first chart!

## The Basics

### File components of a chart

- The **song file**: an `.ogg` or `.mp3` file, that you've exported in the [Exporting with Audacity](../../audio-setup/basic-audio-setup#exporting-with-audacity) step.
- The **album art**: a `.jpg` or `.png` file displayed as the cover image in-game. 
- The **chart** itself: an `.srtb` file, known as **Spin Rhythm Track Bundle**. It contains all note, timing and related assets data.

The file tree below shows where to locate and place all the components:

<FileTree>

- C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\LocalLow\Super&nbsp;Spin&nbsp;Digital\Spin&nbsp;Rhythm&nbsp;XD\Custom
    - AlbumArt ← put your album art covers here!
        - cover.png
        - cover.jpg
    - AudioClips ← put your exported audio files here!
        - song.ogg
        - song.mp3
    - Autosave 
        - Example.srtb ← created every time you edit the chart
    - Previous&nbsp;Saves 
        - Example.srtb ← created every time you save the chart
    - Example.srtb ← the chart file itself
    - BACKUP_Example.zip ← a bundled export that contains all the files needed to upload the chart to SpinShare
</FileTree>

<Aside type='note'>
Most of the time, the filename of the .SRTB will correspond to the name of your song, without any characters that [**Windows/Linux don't allow**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31976060).
The SRXD editor will also not allow you to input said characters in the Title field of your chart info.  
If your song uses any of those characters in its' title, it is possible to insert them back through [**manual SRTB editing**]().

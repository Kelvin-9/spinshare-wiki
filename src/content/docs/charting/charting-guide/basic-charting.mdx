All the basics, best practices and general advice, all in one place. If you're a beginner charter, this page will help you with putting together a great first chart!

## The Basics

### File Components of a Chart

- The **song file**: an `.ogg` or `.mp3` file, that you've exported in the [Exporting with Audacity](../../audio-setup/basic-audio-setup#exporting-with-audacity) step.
- The **album art**: a `.jpg` or `.png` file displayed as the cover image in-game. 
- The **chart** itself: an `.srtb` file, known as **Spin Rhythm Track Bundle**. It contains all note, timing and related assets data.

The file tree below shows where to locate and place all the components:

<FileTree>

- C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\LocalLow\Super&nbsp;Spin&nbsp;Digital\Spin&nbsp;Rhythm&nbsp;XD\Custom
    - AlbumArt ← put your album art covers here!
        - cover.png
        - cover.jpg
    - AudioClips ← put your exported audio files here!
        - song.ogg
        - song.mp3
    - Autosave 
        - Example.srtb ← created every time you edit the chart
    - Previous&nbsp;Saves 
        - Example.srtb ← created every time you save the chart
    - Example.srtb ← the chart file itself
    - BACKUP_Example.zip ← a bundled export that contains all the files needed to upload the chart to SpinShare
</FileTree>

<Aside type='note'>
Most of the time, the filename of the .SRTB will correspond to the name of your song, without any characters that [**Windows/Linux don't allow**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31976060).
The SRXD editor will also not allow you to input said characters in the Title field of your chart info.  
If your song uses any of those characters in its' title, it is possible to insert them back through [**manual SRTB editing**]().

### Note Types

| Tap note | Match note | Spin left | Spin right |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ![Tap note](@images/charting/tap-note.png) | ![Match note](@images/charting/match-note.png) | ![Spin left note note](@images/charting/spin-left-note.png) | ![Spin right note](@images/charting/spin-right-note.png) |
| Requires a timed wheel input by all playstyles and for the wheel to be lined up | Requires only the wheel to be lined up | Requires a quick flick to the left | Requires a quick flick to the left |

### Note Usage


### Note Alignment

Note alignment is a relatively simple but crucial topic. When we talk about alignment, we're referring to the left-right positioning of notes, and how each one aligns with the notes that come before and after it.
The track is split into lanes, which are conventionally numbered 0-6, from left to right. 0 and 6 are the very edges, but 90% of notes will be on lanes 1 and 5. These two lanes are **opposite** to each other. 
This means that if you *mirror* a note on lane 1 (by pressing M with it selected), it will go to lane 5. Match notes very often spill into lanes 2, 3, and 4. As for sliders, it's quite common in XD difficulty 
for slider points to reach for lanes 0 and 6, which we call "wide sliders".
Now that you understand the numbering, let's talk about the charting standard.

#### Taps and Matches

These two are besties. They're almost always together through your chart, and they're really good at creating fun patterns. To make sure your chart is compatible with all playstyles, there's a few things we have to pay attention to.
**1. Matches behind taps**
When you have a long sequence of match notes (often called a "matchstream"), you can basically do whatever you want. But, once it's time to place a tap, **there must be no movement between the tap and the match preceding it**. 
This means that, if the match and tap are the same color, the match should be directly behind the tap. If they're different colors, they should be on opposite lanes (that's a color swap!).

Here are some examples:
(insert examples here teehee)

**2. No movement after lift-off**
While not the official name, charters often call the release notes at the end of sliders "lift-offs". Something similar to the first rule happens here. **There should be no movement between a lift-off and the next note.** (more shit left to write)

Following these guidelines ensures that all playstyles have a fair chance at hitting your patterns. Why some playstyles have difficulty hitting some patterns? That will be discussed in the next section.

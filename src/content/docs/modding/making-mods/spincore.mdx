SpinCore is a multipurpose core library mod developed. This mod provides:
- UI helper functions to help you build a nice interface
- Translation String management
- An abstract trigger interface
- Utility functions for pretty much everything

## Building with the mod

In your mod project, add a reference to `SpinCore.dll`. If you're using JSON serialization features, you can add a reference to `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` or add the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package.

Next, declare your mod depends on SpinCore:

```diff
+using SpinCore;
 ...
 [BepInPlugin("srxd.johndoe.mycoolplugin", "My Cool Plugin", "0.1.0")]
+[BepInDependency(SpinCorePlugin.Guid)]
 internal class MyCoolPlugin : BaseUnityPlugin
 ...
```

This tells BepInEx to load your mod AFTER SpinCore, **only if SpinCore is found and loaded**.

## Working with SpinCore

All the tools provided by SpinCore are used in SpinCore's Test Mod, found on the [SpinCore repository](https://github.com/Raoul1808/SpinCore).
